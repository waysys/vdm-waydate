-- Holidays - Specification for U.S. Federal holidays and Easter.
-- Author: William Shaffer (wshaffer@waysysweb.com)
-- Date: 09 Dec 2023
--
-- This module extends the Date module by providing a specification
-- of U.S. federal holidays and Easter.
--
-- Some of these holidays are positional, meaning that they occur on a 
-- specified day of the week in a month. The remaining holidays occur on 
-- specified dates. However, for this second category, if the date occurs 
-- on a Saturday, the holiday is observed on the preceding Friday. If the 
-- date occurs on a Sunday, the holiday is observed on the following Monday. 
-- Easter is not a federal holiday and is always observed on Sunday.
